## Sample Output

Prompt: When I think of superheroes I think of super humans. I think of Superman, Wolverine and Wonder Woman. Usually they have a cape, or a mask to hide their face just in case. They have X-ray vision and super-human strength. Some can even breathe in outer space. They fly around a while, but always come back to keep our cities safe. They’re here to save humanity from itself. It’s a metaphor for how we look outside ourselves for help, and while the fantasies are fun, I choose to look for me and you.
