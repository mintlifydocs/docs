**Music AI** generates original music compositions from a prompt, lyrics, or musical style. Whether you're a developer, content creator, or musician, this tool provides an easy and flexible way to create music powered by AI.

Key features:

* Compose custom songs using your own lyrics and chosen music style
* Generate complete tracks from a single prompt, including lyrics, instrumentation, and melody
* Apply voice conversion using a custom voice model
* Output options: full tracks, instrumental-only, or vocal-only
* Asynchronous webhook support for seamless integration

Each request generates **two versions** of the song with variation, giving you more creative options.

### Prompt Mode

Supply only a `prompt` and let the system generate everything: lyrics, style, vocals, and more.

> `make_instrumental`, `vocal_only`, and Music AI generation with custom `voice_id` are supported in both modes.

---

## Webhook Delivery

Once the generation is complete, **webhooks** will be triggered to deliver the following:

#### Standard Requests (non-instrumental):
* 2 (webhooks) x Music conversion details (one per version)
* 2 (webhooks) x Lyrics with timestamp data
* 1 (webhook ) x Album cover image

#### Instrumental-only Requests:
