## üß™ Your First AI Song

Let‚Äôs generate a **country song about our love for AI-generated music** ‚ù§Ô∏èüé∏

We‚Äôll use the `MUSIC_AI` feature with the following endpoint:

```http
POST https://api.lalals.com/api/public/v1/MusicAI
```

---

## üì¨ Example Request

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
'https://api.lalals.com/api/public/v1/MusicAI' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: <api_key>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "music_style": "Song about my love to AI Music in Country Style",
  "webhook_url": "http://webhook.yourwebsite.com"
}'
```

> üß† Replace `<api_key>` with your actual API Key from your Lalals dashboard.


## üñß Webhook Integration

To get notified when the music generation is complete, we recommend setting up a webhook. This allows you to receive the URL of the generated song directly.
> üîó Set the `webhook_url` to an endpoint on your server ‚Äî this is where Lalals will notify you once the generation is done.

> **Tip:** If you can‚Äôt use a webhook (e.g., code running on a user device), you can retrive the result through our helper endpoint [get conversion by id](/api-documentation/endpoint/CheckStatus) instead.



---

## üì¶ Example Webhook Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "string",
  "conversion_id": "string",
  "audio_url": "https://...", // signed AWS URL, valid for 1 day
  "conversion_cost": 1.0,
