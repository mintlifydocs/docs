## 🧪 Your First AI Song

Let’s generate a **country song about our love for AI-generated music** ❤️🎸

We’ll use the `MUSIC_AI` feature with the following endpoint:

```http
POST https://api.musicgpt.com/api/public/v1/MusicAI
```

---

## 📬 Example Request

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
'https://api.musicgpt.com/api/public/v1/MusicAI' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: <api_key>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "music_style": "Song about my love to AI Music in Country Style",
  "webhook_url": "http://webhook.yourwebsite.com"
}'
```

> 🧠 Replace `<api_key>` with your actual API Key from your Musicgpt dashboard.


## 🖧 Webhook Integration

To get notified when the music generation is complete, we recommend setting up a webhook. This allows you to receive the URL of the generated song directly.
> 🔗 Set the `webhook_url` to an endpoint on your server — this is where Musicgpt will notify you once the generation is done.

> **Tip:** If you can’t use a webhook (e.g., code running on a user device), you can retrive the result through our helper endpoint [get conversion by id](/api-documentation/endpoint/getById) instead.
