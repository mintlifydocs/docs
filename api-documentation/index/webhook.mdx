title: Webhook Integration
---

When working with asynchronous processes like music generation, voice cloning, or instrumental extraction, waiting for a task to complete can slow down your workflow. That’s where **webhooks** come in handy.

Webhooks allow Musicgpt to notify your application the moment a task is completed. You’ll get all the necessary data — including the audio URL — without needing to constantly poll our API.

---

### 🔧 How It Works

1. **Set the `webhook_url`** when submitting your conversion request.
2. Musicgpt will **send a POST request** to that URL when the task is completed.
3. Your server can then parse the response and proceed with post-processing or user notifications.

### 🧾 Sample Payload
Here's what a typical webhook payload looks like:

```json
{
  "task_id": "12345678-abcd-1234-efgh-567890abcdef",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "status_msg": "Conversion successful",
  "conversion_type": "MUSIC_AI",
  "audio_url": "https://musicgpt.s3.amazonaws.com/audiofile.mp3",
  "title": "Generated Song",
  "conversion_cost": 1.25,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-01T12:05:00Z"
}
```

> 🔗 Set the `webhook_url` to an endpoint on your server — this is where Musicgpt will notify you once the generation is done.

---

### 🛡️ Preliminary Response
When you initiate a conversion request, Musicgpt will immediately respond with a **preliminary response** that includes:
- `success`: whether the task was successfully initiated
- `task_id`: a unique ID you can use to track the conversion

Example:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "12345678-abcd-1234-efgh-567890abcdef"
}
```

This response confirms that the request was accepted. However, the **final result** (like the downloadable file) will be sent **later** to your webhook URL.

### 💡 Can’t Use a Webhook?

No problem — if you’re running code on a client device or you don’t have a public server, you can always check the conversion status manually using our helper endpoint:

### ✅ Why Use Webhooks?
- No need for polling or delays
- Works in the background
- Instantly delivers results
- Ideal for automations and server workflows

Set it once, and let Musicgpt notify you when the magic happens. 🎶
