title: Status Check
---
After performing a conversion via one of our API endpoints, you may want to check the progress or retrieve the final result. You can do this easily by calling our [**Get Conversion by ID**](/api-documentation/endpoint/getById) endpoint.

---

### ðŸ§ª Example Request
Use the following code to check the status of any conversion using its `task_id`:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.lalals.com/api/public/v1/byId"

querystring = {
  "conversionType": "MUSIC_AI",
  "task_id": "12345678-abcd-1234-efgh-567890abcdef"
}

headers = {
  "Authorization": "<api-key>"
}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, params=querystring)
print(response.text)
```

---

### âœ… Example Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "conversion": {
    "task_id": "12345678-abcd-1234-efgh-567890abcdef",
    "conversion_id": "87654321-dcba-4321-hgfe-098765fedcba",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "status_msg": "Conversion successful",
    "audio_url": "https://lalals.s3.amazonaws.com/audiofile.mp3",
    "conversion_cost": 1.25,
    "title": "Generated Song",
    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]...",
    "music_style": "Pop",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-01-01T12:05:00Z"
  }
}
```

Youâ€™ll receive details including:
- `status`: Whether the conversion is **PENDING**, **PROCESSING**, **COMPLETED**, or **FAILED**.
- `status_msg`: A message describing the state.
- `audio_url`: A direct link to your generated audio file if the status is completed.
- Additional metadata such as title, lyrics, style, timestamps, and cost.

### ðŸš€ Where to Start
1. First, perform a conversion via the [Conversion Endpoints](/api-documentations/conversion).
2. Save the `task_id` you receive in the response.
3. Use the **Get By ID** endpoint to check the progress.

---

### ðŸ§  Still Unsure?
No worries â€” head over to the [**Get Conversion by ID**](/api-documentation/endpoint/getById) endpoint and try it for yourself with your own `task_id`. It's the easiest way to confirm conversion status and get direct download access to your audio output!

Stay informed. Stay creative. ðŸŽ§
