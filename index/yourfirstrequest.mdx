## 🧪 Your First AI Song

Let’s generate a **country song about our love for AI-generated music** ❤️🎸

We’ll use the `MUSIC_AI` feature with the following endpoint:

```http
POST https://api.lalals.com/api/public/v1/MusicAI
```

> 🧠 Replace `<api_key>` with your actual API Key from your Lalals dashboard.


## 🖧 Webhook Integration

To get notified when the music generation is complete, we recommend setting up a webhook. This allows you to receive the URL of the generated song directly.
> 🔗 Set the `webhook_url` to an endpoint on your server — this is where Lalals will notify you once the generation is done.

> **Tip:** If you can’t use a webhook (e.g., code running on a user device), you can retrive the result through our helper endpoint [get conversion by id](/api-documentation/endpoint/CheckStatus) instead.
